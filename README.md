# Vespoidea ColDP Archive
A ColDP archive for the [vespid wasps](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/VP) in [Catalogue of Life](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/dataset/1037), originally created by [ZOBODAT](http://www.zobodat.at/).

## Get involved
We keep the data as Tab delimited files (TSV) that together represent a [ColDP archive](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp/blob/master/README.md).
Editing of TSV files can be done locally with simple text editors but also spreadsheet applications
and tools like [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) or online editors like [Datablist](https://app.datablist.com/)
