title: Vespoidea based on Zoological-Botanical Database
alias: Vespoidea (ZOBODAT+)
description: |
  ZOBODAT is a digitally organised biogeographical database including facilities for analysis, documentation and communication. 
  Founded in 1972 by Univ. Prof. Dr. Ernst Rudolf Reichl, ZOBODAT was taken over by the federal county of Upper Austria in 1999. 
  It is located at the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria. 
  The original database includes information about the temporal and spatial distribution of animal and plant species and various supporting information topics.
  Most of the data traditionally refer to insects of Austria, but ZOBODAT can be used for all groups of organisms and world-wide.

  Since 2011 the dataset has not been actively managed. In order to apply feedback and other changes received by the Catalogue of Life and GBIF,
  the data was placed in github for further editing and initially released as version 4.1.
